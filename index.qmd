Hi, I’m **Shreya**, a graduate student at Baruch College, pursuing my **MS in Business Analytics**.  

My journey has taken me through Nepal, India, Australia, and now the United States, shaping me into someone who is adaptable, curious, and eager to keep learning.  

I’m currently diving deep into data analytics** with the goal of becoming a Business Analyst** who can bridge data and decision-making. Outside the classroom, you’ll probably find me traveling, trying new foods, or seeking new experiences**.  

Learn more about my professional journey [**here**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreya-karki/).
