## Welcome

Hi, I’m Shreya , a graduate student at Baruch College, pursuing my MS in Business Analytics.  

My journey has taken me through Nepal, India, Australia, and now the United States, shaping me into someone who is adaptable, curious, and eager to keep learning.  

Currently, I’m focused on building my path toward becoming a Business Analyst, while also nurturing my love for travel, food, and discovering new experiences.
