Hi! My name is **Shreya**, and I am a graduate student at Baruch College, pursuing my **MS in Business Analytics**.  

## About Me  

I have had the chance to call a few different countries my home — born and raised in **Nepal**, did my schooling in **India**, and completed my **undergraduate degree in International Business** in **Australia** before moving to the **United States** for graduate study.  

These experiences have made me adaptable, curious, and always eager to learn something new. Now, I am diving into the world of **data analytics** and shaping my path toward becoming a **Business Analyst**,  while still keeping a love for travel, food, and discovering new experiences along the way!
