---

Hi, I’m Shreya , a graduate student at Baruch College, pursuing my MS in Business Analytics.  

*A global learner with a love for data, business, and new ideas.*

My journey has taken me through Nepal, India, Australia, and now the United States, shaping me into someone who is adaptable, curious, and eager to keep learning.  

These days, I’m diving deep into Data with a goal of growing into a Business Analyst who can bridge and decision making.Outside of classrom, you'll probably find me traveling, trying new foods, or chasing new experiences.
